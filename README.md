Uber Data Analysis Portfolio Project – Power BI
"I may not drive for Uber, but I’ve definitely taken data for a few rides."
Over the past few days, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Uber ride data across multiple vehicle types — Auto, Bike, Go Mini, Go Sedan, Premier Sedan, and Uber XL.
Let’s just say, instead of waiting for my Uber to arrive, I decided to make one arrive… in Power BI.
The goal of this project was to turn raw Uber ride data into meaningful insights — exploring how different vehicles perform, how customers behave, and how revenue trends shift over time.
Project Overview
This dashboard provides an end-to-end view of Uber’s operations, focusing on:
Total bookings, completed rides, and cancellations
Revenue performance by vehicle type and payment mode
Customer and driver satisfaction ratings
Top pickup and drop-off locations
It’s basically a GPS for data — helping Uber navigate through numbers instead of traffic.
Dashboard Highlights
Overview Dashboard: Quick performance snapshot for management.
Vehicle Dashboard: Compares how each ride type performs.
Revenue Dashboard: Tracks payment trends and top customer contributions.
Because when it comes to data storytelling, every chart should feel like a smooth ride.
Tools and Skills Used
Power BI | Power Query | DAX | Excel | Data Modeling | Data Visualization | Business Intelligence

Learning Outcomes
This project helped me sharpen my ability to:
Clean and model raw data (because messy data is like traffic on a Monday morning)
Build dynamic KPIs using DAX

Create dashboards that make insights easy to “ride along” with
Tell a business story through visuals that even non-analysts can understand
